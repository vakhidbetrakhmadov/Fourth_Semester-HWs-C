This is a small linux utiliy.

Usage: ./exe string dirname

Purpose: Counts total number of "string"s in all ASCII TEXT files in the given directory and all subdirectories and prints their coordinates to the log.txt file.

Note. Utility acts as if the files has no whitespaces at all. Example: str .. ing is still "string"
Note. This is just a practise for multiprocessing in C.
